CLR -> common language runtime 
Execution engine of .NET. It is the virtual machine that runs .NET applications. 

CTS -> Common Type System
defines all the Datatypes

CLS -> common Language Specification
A set of rules that languages must follow to be interoperable in .NET.

MSIL / CIL (Intermediate Language)
code generated after .net compiling

JIT Compiler (Just-In-Time):
convert IL -> Machine Languag

GAC (Global Assembly Cache) -> all the 

SOLID in real projects -> design concept

S -> Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
    A class should have one reason to change (one responsibility).
    if need to change email provider need to changes in class (testing difficult)
        public class OrderService
    {
        public void CreateOrder(Order order) { }
        public void SaveToDatabase(Order order) { }
        public void SendEmail(Order order) { }
        public void GenerateInvoicePdf(Order order) { }
        public void LogOrder(Order order) { }
    }
O —> Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
    Code should be open for extension, closed for modification.
    ek payment method k ander multiple functions ki jagah ek interface banake func usse inherit karlenge

L — Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
    A child class must behave in a way that does not break the expectations of the parent.
    class ke uper depend ki jagah interface ke upar depend karo

I — Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
    interface multiple banalo ek me dalne ki jagah
D — Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
    high level module should not depend on low level

delegate -> hold refrences of fucntion (behaviour passing)
real life -> sorting what to use as key (diff functions)
has delegate in  name and can refer to any function
can refer to multiple funct (both func executes)

public delegate int MathOperation(int a, int b);
public class Calculator
{
    public static int Add(int x, int y) => x + y;
    public static int Multiply(int x, int y) => x * y;
}

Callback -> control move to another object 

Events -> Publish subscribe
