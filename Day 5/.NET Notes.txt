CLR - running, managing, and securing managed code. 
    manages code, handles memory management, JIT compilation, exception handling, type safety, and thread management.
Flow:
c# code -> c# compiler -> IL -> CLR -> JIT -> Machine 

JIT -> Convert IL Code -> machine Specific (Platform independece)
3 types:
    pre -> convert all code at once
    econo -> convert methods when needed release later
    normal -> converts method once , keep in memory (default)
compilation happens per methods

GC-> allocate and free
no manual
Dispose()	-> Release unmanaged resources
using-> 	Ensures deterministic cleanup
GC.SuppressFinalize() -> 	Avoid finalizer
GC.Collect()->	Force GC (not recommended)

        static vs abstract
    dono ka object create nahi ho sakta
    abstract supports inheritance so polymorphism possible
    static state is global while abstract  is instance based

Abstract classes represent incomplete concepts and must be inherited to provide concrete implementations. (object  cannot be created)
